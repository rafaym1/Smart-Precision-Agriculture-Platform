# 🌱 Smart Precision Agriculture Platform Prototype

This repository contains a prototype for a **Smart Precision Agriculture Platform**, designed to leverage **data science and machine learning** to predict optimal crop conditions. Using the **SF24 dataset**, the project applies **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, feature analysis, and a **logistic regression model** to forecast the best conditions for crops.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Name:** SF24 (Smart Farming 2024)
- **Description:** The dataset includes various environmental, soil, and crop-related features such as temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, and more.
- **Goal:** Predict the **optimal crop condition** based on the feature set.

## 📜 Results
- Logistic Regression achieved **X% accuracy** (replace with actual result).
- EDA highlighted that **rainfall and soil pH** were the most influential factors for crop health.
- This prototype serves as a foundation for building **AI-driven precision agriculture systems**.
